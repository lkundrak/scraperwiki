    <h2 class="inline">What is ScraperWiki?</h2>
    <p class="first">There&rsquo;s lots of useful data on the internet &ndash; crime
    statistics, government spending, <a href="http://www.nationalpetregister.org/">missing kittens</a>&hellip;</p>
    <p>But getting at it isn&rsquo;t always easy. There's a table here, a report
    there, a few web pages, PDFs, spreadsheets&hellip; And it can be scattered over
    thousands of different places on the web, making it hard to see the whole
    picture and the story behind it. It&rsquo;s like trying to build something
    from Lego when someone has hidden the bricks all over town and you have to
    find them before you can start building!</p>
</div>
<div class="column-right">
    <p>To get at data, programmers write bits of code called &lsquo;screen
    scrapers&rsquo;, which extract the useful bits so they can be reused in
    other apps, or rummaged through by journalists and researchers. But these
    bits of code tend to break,  get thrown away or forgotten once they have
    been used, and so the data is lost again. Which is bad.</p> 

    <p>ScraperWiki is an online tool to make that process simpler and more
    collaborative. Anyone can write a screen scraper using the online editor.
    In the free version, the code and data are shared with the world. 
    Because it's a wiki, other programmers can contribute to and improve the
    code.</p>

    <p>If you're not a programmer, or if you want to tackle a large or complex
    task, you can ask the ScraperWiki team to 
    <a href="{% url request_data %}">organise it for you</a>.</p>
