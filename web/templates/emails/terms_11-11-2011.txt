Hi! Just letting you know that ScraperWiki's T&Cs are changing. 
The main updates are:

 1. New terms for "vaults." Vaults are a way to host a group of
    scrapers in private, so you can choose who can access them
    and their data. The terms also now make it clear that you own
    your private scrapers.

 2. General terms to do with charging for services. This is
    because we'll soon be offering premium features like vaults
    on a self-service basis. (If you'd like a vault in the
    meantime, visit https://scraperwiki.com/pricing/)

You can view the new T&Cs, and a diff against the old ones, here:
https://scraperwiki.com/terms_and_conditions/

The new T&Cs will come into force for existing users in a 
week's time, at 6PM (GMT) on Friday, 18th November.

Best wishes,
Francis & the ScraperWiki team
