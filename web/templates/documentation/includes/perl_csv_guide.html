<p>Comma-separated value files are a quite commonly used text form of
spreadsheet. To process them often requires special cases, such as
parsing dates or removing bad rows.</p>

<p>For more details, read the <a href="http://fastercsv.rubyforge.org/">full
    FasterCSV documentation</a>. This <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/940774/how-do-you-change-headers-in-a-csv-file-with-fastercsv-then-save-the-new-headers">question on StackOverflow</a> gives some idea
of the kinds of thing in can do.</p>

<h2>Reading rows</h2>

<p>Download the CSV file first. (If there are quirks in the input file, you
might at this point want to preprocess the data using, for example, the
.gsub function)
</p>


<code>data = ScraperWiki.scrape("http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ukhmgdata-cabinetoffice/Spend-data-2010-11-01/Spend-Transactions-with-descriptions-HMT-09-Sep-2010.csv")
</code>

<p>Load it into the standard Ruby CSV reader. It needs to be an array of lines.</p>

<code>require 'fastercsv'
fcsv = FCSV.new(data)
</code>

<p>You can then loop through the rows as if they were an array.</p>

<code>for row in fcsv:
  puts format("Â£%s spent on %s", row[7], row[3])
end
</code>

<h2>Saving to the datastore</h2>

<p>Conventionally the first line gives the names for the columns. You
can get the standard reader to load in each row as a hash, where
the keys are those names.</p>

<code>fcsv = FCSV.new(data, :headers =&gt; true)
</code>

<p>This makes it easy to save the data. By default everything
comes out as strings. We convert the 'Amount' row to a number type, 
so that it can then be added and sorted.</p>

<code>for row in fcsv
  if row['Transaction Number']
    row['Amount'] = row['Amount'].to_f
    ScraperWiki.save_sqlite(unique_keys=['Transaction Number', 'Expense Type', 'Expense Area'], row.to_hash)
  end
end
</code>
