<p>Comma-separated value files are a quite commonly used text form of
spreadsheet. To process them often requires special cases, such as
parsing dates or removing bad rows.</p>

<p>For more details, read the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Text::CSV_XS/">full
    Text::CSV_XS documentation</a>.</p>

<h2>Reading rows</h2>

<p>Download the CSV file first and split it into rows. If there are quirks in the input file, you
might at this point want to preprocess the data using, for example, the
map with chomp or s/// regexes.
</p>


<code>my @data =
        map { s/\r$//; $_ } # Get rid of CR/LF
        split /\n/, # Split into lines
        Scraperwiki::scrape('http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ukhmgdata-cabinetoffice/Spend-data-2010-11-01/Spend-Transactions-with-descriptions-HMT-09-Sep-2010.csv');
</code>

<p>Create an instance of Text::CSV_XS.</p>

<code>use Text::CSV_XS;

my $csv = new Text::CSV_XS;
</code>

<p>You can then loop through the input data and parse a row after row, getting arrays of the fields. We can save the first row for later use.</p>

<code>
my @header;
foreach (@data) {
        $csv-&gt;parse($_) or die $csv-&gt;error_input;
        my @row = $csv-&gt;fields;

        # First line
        unless (@header) {
                @header = @row;
                next;
        }

        printf "Â£%s spent on %s\n", $row[7], $row[3];
}
$csv-&gt;eof or $csv-&gt;error_diag;
</code>

<h2>Saving to the datastore</h2>

<p>We can now use the fields from the first row as keys for fields for the data rows.</p>

<code>Scraperwiki::save_sqlite(unique_keys =&gt; ['Transaction Number', 'Expense Type', 'Expense Area'],
	data =&gt; { map { $header[$_] =&gt; @row[$_] } 0..$#row });
</code>
