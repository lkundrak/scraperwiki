<p>Write a real scraper by copying and pasting code, for programmers or
non-programmers (30 minutes).
</p>

<h2>1. Make a new scraper</h2>

<p>We're going to scrape the averge number of years children spend
in school in different countries from 
<a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/socind/education.htm">this page</a> on a UN site.
</p>

<p>Pick "new scraper" from the main menu on the right, and choose PHP.
(If you're more comfortable with Python or Ruby, choose a different language
above). You'll get a web based code editor.
</p>

<p>Put in a few lines of code to show it runs, and click the "Run" button or
type Ctrl+R.
</p>

<code>print "Hello, coding in the cloud!";
</code>

<p>(As we go through this tutorial, you can copy and paste each 
block of code onto the end of your growing scraper, and run it each time.)</p>

<p>The code runs on ScraperWiki's servers. You can see any output you
printed in the Console tab at the bottom of the editor.
</p>

<h2>2. Download HTML from the web</h2>

<p>You can use any normal PHP function to crawl the web, such as cURL.
There is also a simple built in {% doc_link_full 'LANG_help_documentation' language 'ScraperWiki function' %} which may be easier to use.
</p>

<code>$html = scraperWiki::scrape("http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/socind/education.htm");
print $html . "\n";
</code>

<p>When you print something quite large, click "more" in the console
to view it all. Alternatively, go to the Sources tab in the editor to see
everything that has been downloaded.</p>

<h2>3. Parsing the HTML to get your content</h2>

<p>To help your parse the HTML we provide a Simple HTML DOM script that you can use as follows.
</p>

<code>require 'scraperwiki/simple_html_dom.php';
$dom = new simple_html_dom();
$dom->load($html);
foreach($dom->find("div[@align='left'] tr.tcont") as $data){
    $tds = $data->find("td");
    $record = array(
        'country' => $tds[0]->plaintext, 
        'years_in_school' => intval($tds[4]->plaintext)
    );
    print_r($record);
}
</code>

<p>The bits of code like 'tr.tcont' are CSS selectors, just like 
those used to style HTML.
</p>

<h2>4. Saving to the ScraperWiki datastore</h2>

<p>The datastore is a magic SQL store, one where you don't need to make
a schema up front.</p>

<p>Replace "print_r($record);" in the loop with this save command:</p>

<code>    scraperwiki::save(array('country'), $record);
</code>

<p>The unique keys (just country in this case) identify each piece of data.
When the scraper runs again, existing data with the same values for the
unique keys is replaced.</p>

<p>Go to the Data tab in the editor to see the data loading in. 
Wait until it has finished.</p>

<h2>5. Getting the data out again</h2>

<p>If you haven't done so yet, press "save scraper" at the bottom
right of the editor. You'll need to give your scraper a title, and to make a
ScraperWiki account if you don't have one already.</p>

<p>Now, click on the Scraper tab at the top right to see a preview of your
data.  The easiest way to get it all out is to "Download spreadsheet (CSV)".
</p>

<p>For more complex queries "Explore with ScraperWiki API". Try this
query in the SQL query box.</p>

<code>select * from swdata order by years_in_school desc limit 10
</code>

<p>It gives you the records for the ten countries where children spend
the most years at school. </p>

<p>Notice that as well as JSON, you can also get custom CSV files using 
the SQL query in the URL.</p>

<h2>What next?</h2>

<p>If you have a scraper you want to write, and feel ready, then get going. Otherwise...
