<p>Comma-separated value files are a quite commonly used text form of
spreadsheet. To process them often requires special cases, such as
parsing dates or removing bad rows.</p>

<p>For more details, read the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/csv.html">full
Python CSV documentation</a>.

<h2>Reading rows</h2>

<p>Download the CSV file first. (If there are quirks in the input file, you
might at this point want to preprocess the data using, for example, the
.replace function)
</p>

<code>import scraperwiki
data = scraperwiki.scrape("http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ukhmgdata-cabinetoffice/Spend-data-2010-11-01/Spend-Transactions-with-descriptions-HMT-09-Sep-2010.csv")
</code>

<p>Load it into the standard Python CSV reader. It needs to be a list of lines.</p>

<code>import csv
reader = csv.reader(data.splitlines())
</code>

<p>You can then loop through the rows as if they were a list.</p>

<code>for row in reader:
    print "Â£%s spent on %s" % (row[7], row[3])
</code>

<h2>Saving to the datastore</h2>

<p>Conventionally the first line gives the names for the columns. You
can get the standard reader to load in each row as a dictionary, where
the keys are those names.</p>

<code>reader = csv.DictReader(data.splitlines())
</code>

<p>This makes it easy to save the data. By default everything
comes out as strings. We convert the 'Amount' row to a number type, 
so that it can then be added and sorted.</p>

<code>for row in reader:
    if row['Transaction Number']:
        row['Amount'] = float(row['Amount'])
        scraperwiki.sqlite.save(unique_keys=['Transaction Number', 'Expense Type', 'Expense Area'], data=row)
</code>
