<p>Learn to make a view by copying and pasting code, for programmers or non-programmers (30 minutes).</p>

<h2>1. Make a new view</h2>

<p>If you haven't already, please do the {% doc_link_full 'LANG_intro_tutorial' language %} first.
</p>

<p>Find the school life expectancy scraper that you made 
(or use <a href="https://scraperwiki.com/scrapers/school_life_expectancy_in_years/">this one we made earlier</a>). 
Half way down, in the views section, choose "create a new view" and pick PHP as your language.
</p>

<p>Put in a few lines of code, and click the "Preview" button or type Ctrl+P.
</p>

<code>print "This is a &lt;em&gt;fragment&lt;/em&gt; of HTML.";
</code>

<p>A new browser tab will open, and after a moment the rendered output will appear.</p>


<h2>2. Query the scraper's datastore</h2>

<p>Before you can read the scraper's datastore from the view, you 
need to attach to it.</p>

<code>scraperwiki::attach("school_life_expectancy_in_years");
</code>

<p>You can attach to as many datastores as you like. Then you can access their
tables directly from queries.</p>

<code>$data = scraperwiki::select(
    "* from school_life_expectancy_in_years.swdata 
    order by years_in_school desc limit 10"
);
print_r($data);
</code>

<p>The data comes back as an array of arrays.</p>

<h2>3. Print out the results</h2>

<p>To output, you simply print to standard output.

<code>print "&lt;table&gt;";
print "&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Country&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Years in school&lt;/th&gt;";
foreach($data as $d){
  print "&lt;tr&gt;";
  print "&lt;td&gt;" . $d["country"] . "&lt;/td&gt;";
  print "&lt;td&gt;" . $d["years_in_school"] . "&lt;/td&gt;";
  print "&lt;/tr&gt;";
}
print "&lt;/table&gt;";
</code>

<p>That's a simple example outputting HTML.</p>

<p>You could output a KML file, an iCal file, an RSS feed, or whatever you
need.</p>
